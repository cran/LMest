\title{Draw samples from the basic LM model}

\description{Function that draws samples from the basic LM model with specific parameters.}

\usage{
draw_lm_basic(piv, Pi, Psi, n)
}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{piv }{vector of initial probabilities of the latent Markov chain}
  \item{Pi }{set of transition probabilities matrices (k x k x TT)}
  \item{Psi }{array of conditional response probabitlies (mb x k x r)}
  \item{n }{sample size}
}

\value{
  \item{Y }{matrix of response configurations unit by unit}
  \item{S }{matrix of distinct response configurations}
  \item{yv }{corresponding vector of frequencies}
}

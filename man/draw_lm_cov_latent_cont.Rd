\title{Draw samples from LM model for continuous outcomes with covariaates in the latent model}

\description{Function that draws samples from the LM model for continuous outcomes with individual covariates with specific parameters.}

\usage{
draw_lm_cov_latent_cont(X1, X2, param = "multilogit", Mu, Si, Be, Ga, fort = TRUE)
}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X1 }{desing matrix for the covariates on the initial probabilities (n x nc1)}
  \item{X2 }{desing matrix for the covariates on the transition probabilities (n x TT-1 x nc2)}
  \item{param }{type of parametrization for the transition probabilities ("multilogit" = standard multinomial logit for every row of the transition matrix, "difflogit" = multinomial logit based on the difference between two sets of parameters)}
  \item{Mu }{array of conditional means for the response variables (r x k)}
  \item{Si }{var-cov matrix common to all states (r x r)}
  \item{Be }{parameters affecting the logit for the initial probabilities}
  \item{Ga }{parametes affecting the logit for the transition probabilities}
  \item{fort}{to use fortran routine when possible (FALSE for not use fortran)}}

\value{
  \item{Y }{array of continuous outcomes (n x TT x r)}
  \item{U }{matrix containing the sequence of latent states (n x TT)}

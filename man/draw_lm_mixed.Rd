\title{Draws samples from the mixed LM model}

\description{Function that draws samples from the mixed LM model with specific parameters.}

\usage{
draw_lm_mixed(la, Piv, Pi, Psi, n, TT)
}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{la }{vector of mass probabilities for the first latent variable}
  \item{Piv }{matrix of initial probabilities of the latent Markov chain (k2 x k1)}
  \item{Pi }{set of transition matrices (k2 x k2 x k1)}
  \item{Psi }{array of conditional response probabitlies (mb x k2 x r)}
  \item{n }{sample size}
  \item{TT }{number of time occasions}
}

\value{
  \item{Y }{matrix of response configurations unit by unit}
  \item{S }{matrix of distinct response configurations}
  \item{yv }{corresponding vector of frequencies}
}

# draw a sample for 1000 units and only one response variable and 5 time occasions
